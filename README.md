Draw the "Kifune" plot - the integral number of high energy sources detected as a function of year - in the style of a plot developped by Tadashi Kifune (for example http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996NCimC..19..953K).

The data for the number of X-ray and HE (GeV) gamma-ray sources come from a page on HEASARC maintained by Stephen A. Drake (retrieved 2017-09-28) : https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/headates/how_many_xray.html

The data for the number of VHE (TeV) gamma-ray sources is from TeVCat maintained by Deirdre Horan and Scott Wakely  (retrieved 2017-09-28) : http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/
